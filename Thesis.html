							<p>Aerosols are minute particles suspended in the atmosphere. It can be solid particles or liquid droplets.
							Size ranges from few nm to several micrometers. They are ubiquitous in the Earth’s atmosphere and can be
							found over ocean, deserts, mountains, forests, ice and every ecosystem in between. Aerosols have major
							impact on our climate, by interacting both directly and indirectly with the incoming solar radiation, and
							health through inhalation of these particles. They also serve as a site for heterogeneous chemical reaction
							leading to destruction of stratosphere ozone. Although most aerosols reflect sunlight, some absorb it.
							Aerosol’s effect on light depends primarily on the composition and color of the particles, both of which
							depends on how the molecules of the aerosol interacting with light.
							There are varieties of aerosols with different properties, pure sulfates and nitrates reflect nearly all radiation
							they encounter, cooling the atmosphere but black carbon absorbs radiation and warms the atmosphere. Depending on
							the sources, we see different types of aerosols. When the aerosol particles cluster grow to or beyond 100 nm, they
							can now serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Aerosol number concentration effects number of CCN in the
							atmosphere and this result in changes in cloud physical and optical properties which lead to climate changes.
							Human health is affected through inhalation of aerosol particles, especially in urban areas [Wichmann & Peters,
							2000; Stieb, Judek, & Burnett, 2002]. In addition to chemical composition, aerosols size controls how it
							penetrates into biological tissues such as in the lung lining. The health impacts of aerosols consist of both
							short-term severe symptoms, like asthma and bronchitis and long-term chronic irritation and inflammation of
							the respiratory track, which can potentially lead to cancer. Additionally, epidemiological studies have found
							a correlation between daily mortality [], and hospitalization data and particle concentration in outdoor air
							[].
							Key to understanding the impact of aerosol is to understand the formation of new aerosol particles and their
							subsequent growth. Aitken (1897) was the first to show new particle formation (NPF) in the atmosphere through
							empirical evidence. NPF is characterized by a sharp increase in number concentrations of aerosol particles and
							subsequent growth of these particles. Since then new particle formation event are arbitrarily defined by appearance
							of particles ≤ 3 nm diameter particles which subsequently grows [Kulmala et al 2004]. This arbitrary 3 nm diameter
							is the result of scanning mobility analyzer’s (DMA) lower size efficient detection limit. Therefore many authors
							refer to sub-3 nm particles as molecular clusters and the larger particles are referred to as nanoparticles. So
							far our knowledge of NPF events and their impact on climate are based mostly on measurements of particle size
							distribution with time.
							It was proposed in Shugard et al., 1974, in order to form a new particle, the molecular clusters have to grow past
							a thermodynamically stable size, also refer to as critical nucleus, in process called nucleation, where clusters
							are formed spontaneously from the gas phase. In atmospheric nucleation new aerosol particles are formed form gas
							to particle conversion. Nucleation is defined as formation of molecular embryos or clusters prior to formation of
							a new phase during the transformation of vapor to liquid to solid. Nucleation can be characterized by a decrease
							in both enthalpy and entropy of the nucleating system. Thermodynamically favorable according the first law but not
							so according to the second law therefore the system need to surmount a free energy barrier before transformation
							to the new phase becomes spontaneous. The critical size of the aerosol before the growth becomes spontaneous is
							the critical nucleus. The rate at which nucleation occurs is related to the chemical makeup of the critical nucleus,
							the gaseous concentrations of the nucleating species and it’s an important variable in simulations of aerosol
							formation in atmospheric models. Nucleation is also the process through which atmosphere maintains large reservoir
							of thermodynamically stable clusters of aerosol particles in the atmosphere at all times. Through review of 100
							journal articles nucleation events have been identified to occur, over continental boundary layer, in polluted
							urban areas, industrial plumes that contain sulfur dioxide, in the out-flows of convective clouds, over exposed
							tidal zones [Kulmala et al., 2004]. Nucleation events were often measured over several hundred kilometers. These
							events are referred to as reginal nucleation event and leads to increases in number concentrations by factor of
							two to ten.
							The challenge afforded by nucleation episodes depend on complex interplay between meteorology, pollution sources,
							and atmospheric chemical processes. Since, nucleation is the least understood processes of aerosol production,
							creating a large uncertainty in atmosphere model and weather perdition. The link between nucleation and formation
							of CCN needs to be understood so a more reliable and accurate global climate models can be developed. The effects
							of nucleation, secondary source of aerosol particles, are not well understood because the molecular species
							participating in the process and subsequent growth have not yet been identified for certain. In order to better
							understand these effects we need detail information on how aerosol particles are formed and how they are transformed
							in the atmosphere. Essential information about aerosol particles are number of neutral particles smaller than 3nm,
							physico-chemical properties e.g., solubility in different solvents, chemical composition of nucleation mode particles
							and measurements of gas phase species that participate in nucleation and growth.
							Several groups have suggested that gaseous sulfuric acid is the main driver of daytime atmospheric aerosol formation,
							these studies revealed that the number density of new particles correlated with the amount of sulfuric acid present
							[weber, 1995 and 1997]. When growth rates and gaseous H2SO4 concentrations were both measured during nucleation
							events, calculations show that H2SO4 condensation typically accounts for only 10 to 30% (what does that mean?) of
							the observed growth [Weber et al., 1997; Weber et al., 1998; Birmili et al., 2003]. New particle formation was not
							observed during periods when sulfuric acid concentrations were below 5.0x105 cm-3. These evidences indicates sulfuric
							acid is required for aerosol formation [McMurry., 1995]. Sulfuric acid is clearly major atmospheric nucleating
							species (kulmala et al 2004; McMurry et al, 2005).
							In practice it is very important to investigate nucleation and growth processes separately, since different species
							can participate in these processes [Kulmala et al 2004]. Organic compound with low saturation vapor pressure (such
							as organic acid) appear to be a candidates for nucleation [Zhang et al, 2004a] and seems to be involved in growth
							of the particles. The rate at which aerosol particles grow depend on rate of evaporation and condensation of
							constituents during subcritical cluster [McMurry., 1995]. The growth of these clusters is also hampered by scavenging
							loss of nucleated clusters to preexisting particles. Experimental measurements have shown that rate of new particle
							formation predicted by proposed classical binary nucleation mechanisms, involving homogeneous nucleation of water
							and sulfuric acid [Jaecker-Voirol and Mirabel, 1989], is far less than what is being observed [McMurry., 1995].
							These evidences/observations suggest a possibility of other molecules participating in stabilizing the cluster such
							as Ternary Sulfuric acid-ammonia-water [Weber et al 1999], Ion-induced [Yu and Turco, 2001; lee et al 2003], and
							Organic acid [Zhang et al 2004a]. With only one exception [Wiedensohler et al., 1997a], observed nucleation events
							always occur during daytime, suggesting that photochemistry plays a central role in this process.</p>

							<div class="col-md-12"><span>In the early twentieth century, physicists found that classical mechanics does not correctly
								describe the behavior of very small particles such as the electrons and nuclei of atoms and  molecules. When one
								or more dimensions at a material fall below 100nm (and especially below 20nm) dramatic changes in the optical,
								electronic, chemical,and other properties from those of the bulk material can occur. Quantume mechanics  (QM),
								a set of laws governing the subatomic world, was developed after the experimental observations such as blackbody
								radiation, photoelectric effect, double slit experiment, particles scattering off a crystal, Stern-Gerlach experiment,
								development of Bohr and deBroglie model and formulation of Maxwell's equations. Theoretical chemistry is defined as
								mathematical description of chemistry and when the mathematical method is sufficiently developed to be automated for
								implementation on a computer then it is referred to as computational chemistry. [Brief history leading to computational
								chemistry] Increase in the use of computational chemistry is due to development of easy to use software and advances in
								capability of hardware. Calculations can be performed without knowing the underlying principle; never the less subsequent
								paragraphs are an attempt to clarify the theoretical background of the methods used in the research. As a chemist we would
								like to describe the properties of well-defined collection of atoms. The goal is to find the energy of the system, one of
								the most useful concepts in science, and more importantly how the energy changes base on the orientation of the individual
								atoms. To achieve these goals the position of atom’s nucleus and electrons are defined in order to calculate the energy based
								on their interaction.</span></div>

							<div class="col-md-12"><span>Schrödinger’s formulation of the Quantum mechanics is the basis for nearly all computational chemistry methods.
								The Schrödinger equation is Where  is the Hamiltonian operator, Ψ is a set of solutions, or a eigenstate, describing the state of the
								system. For Ψ to be a wavefunction describing a state of a particle, it has to be a single valued, continuous and differentiable, finite
								and normalized. When operate  operates on the eigenfunction Ψ, an eigenvalue E and the same eigenfunction is returned, where E is the
								energy of the system and  is the energy operator. The total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy therefore quantum mechanical
								expression of the Hamiltonian operator  for molecule with n-electrons is
								The symbols α and β refer to nuclei and i and j refer to electrons. The first term gives kinetic energy of the nuclei. The second term is
								kinetic energy of the electrons. The third term is the potential energy due to repulsion between the nuclei with distance of r<sub>αβ</sub> between α
								and β nuclei and atomic number of Z<sub>α</sub> and Z<sub>β</sub>. The fourth term is potential energy due to Caulomic attraction between the nuclei and the electrons.
								The fifth term is potential energy due to repulsion between the electrons i and j with distance rij. The restriction i>j and α>β is to not count
								repulsion terms twice. This formulation is the time-independent, nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation. There are additional terms in Hamiltonian
								when relativity or interactions with electromagnetic radiation or fields are taken into account. Due to the complexity of the above equation, it
								is almost never used in currently available software. In order to obtain a physically relevant solution of the Schrödinger equation, the wave
								function must be continuous, single-valued, normalizable, and antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of electrons. The experimentally
								observable quantity is the probability density |Ψ(x,y,z,t)|2, where the value does not change with time, therefore square of time-dependent
								wavefunction, |Ψ(x,y,z,t)|2, is equal to the square of the time-independent wavefunction . The square of the time-independent wavefunction is
								referred to as stationary state; because the probability density  is stationary not the particles. Once a wave function is constructed, any property
								of the individual molecules can be determined, by using operator for that property. This is accomplished by taking the expectation value of the
								operation given by
								Where ψ* is the complex conjugate wavefucntion. For exact wave function this will predict the exact energy given by Schrödinger equation. For an
								approximate wave function, this gives an approximation of the energy, which is the basis for many of the techniques described in rest of the chapter
								and utilized in this research. The Schrödinger equation involves 3N independent variables, three coordinates for N electrons. The potential energy
								term, due to electron repulsion is not separable in any coordinate system. The perturbation method separates the Hamiltonian, Ĥ, into two parts, the
								unperturbed Ĥ0, and the perturbation Ĥ'. When the electron-electron interaction is taken as the perturbation and put it aside, the many-electron
								problem is simplified greatly. This assumption allows the separation of the Hamiltonian and the total electronic wavefunction Ψn into the motion of N
								individual non-interacting electrons. The system would be product of N hydrogenlike, one-electorn, wavefunctions (orbitals), Ψ0 = ϕ1(r1)ϕ2(r2 )…ϕn(rn),
								where Ψ0 is zeroth-order wavefunction meaning no perturbation is included. This product of single electron wavefunctions is known as Hartree Product.
								If we are interested in single molecule of water, ignoring the nuclei coordinates  because there are lot more electrons than nuclei in large systems,
								the full spin-less wavefuntion is 20-dimentional function (3 dimensions for each of the 10 electrons), for sulfuric acid 100-dimentional and for a quaternary
								(H2SO4-NH3-H2C2O4-H2O) aerosol cluster 1,188 dimensions. It can be seen from these numbers the cost of trying to solve the Schrödinger equation. The
								situation gets worst when we include the perturbation electron-electron interaction because assuming electrons don’t interact with each other is a serious
								approximation. When the columbic interaction is ignored, effects born out of those interactions such as the shielding effects are also excluded, in other words,
								the Schrödinger equation is a many body problem. Over the course of computational chemistry’s existence, in attempts to solve the Schrödinger equation,
								scientists have developed many approximation methods, such as perturbation, variation, Hartree-Fock Self-consistent-Field (HF-SCF) and density functional
								method (DFT). The above Hamiltonian operator can be simplified by separating the nuclear and electron motions. Born-Oppenheimer approximation, a mathematical
								trick, assumes that relative to the electrons, nucleus is stationary because the nucleus is 1800 times the mass of an electron. The physical significance
								of this observation results in elections responding much more quickly than nuclei to any changes to their surroundings, resulting in simpler Hamiltonian
								operator
								This assumption simplifies the Hamiltonian operator by removing the kinetic energy term and making internuclear repulsion potential energy (VNN) term a
								constant. This constant is added to the purely electronic energy after solving the electronic Schrödinger equation. Born-Oppenheimer approximation, perturbation
								and variation methods greatly simplified the problem but we still need to content with exponential growth in dimensional of the function depending on the
								size of the system. This prompted a search for function with fewer variables than the wavefunction. All information is in wavefunction according to QM but
								density |ψ|2 has as much information as wavefunctions and |ψ|2 need to be solved in order to get any useful information. The first theorem of Hohenberg and
								Kohn proves the existence of a ground state electron probability density ρ(x,y,z) that uniquely determines for molecules with a nondegenerate ground state,
								the ground-state molecular energy, wavefunction, and all other molecular electronic properties. The following is the proof of Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. The purely
								electronic energy Hamiltonian (above), after applying the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, is the sum of electronic kinetic-energy terms, electron-nuclear
								attractions, and electron-electron repulsions. Atomic units are employed here on, unless otherwise specified. Theoreticians, and thus software developers,
								work with a system of units called atomic units, where many of the fundamental constants are defined as having a value of 1. Only in the second term does
								the position of the nuclei needs to be defined. This is also where type of problem is defined, for example water molecule or body-centered cubic (bcc) iron,
								by the fixed positions of the nuclei. In the context of the DFT this potential is referred to as the external potential, external because the coulomb potential
								produced by the nuclei in which the system of electrons move. Once the external potential υ(ri) and the number of electron N is determined, the electronic
								Schrödinger equation can be solved and electronic wavefunction and allowed energies of the molecule can be determined. The Hohenberg-Kohn proved for system
								with nondegenerate ground-state electron, the ground-state electron probability density ρ0(r) (the zero subscript indicates the ground state) determines the
								external potential and the number of electrons. The probability density ρ for finding an electron at point (x, y, z) and in volume dx, dy, dz is
								Where r and ms are spaceal and spin coordinates. If we integrate the above equation over all space and use the normalization of ψ to get, to determines the
								number of electron. Normally, once we know the external potential we can get the electronic wavefunction that is the set of solution to the Schrödinger equation
								for that particular external potential, and therefore the set of densities that corresponds to that particular wavefunction. There arises a possibility of a
								wavefunction that is set of solutions to the Schrödinger equation for two different systems, for two different external potentials. This possibility implies
								that there are two systems (i.e. two solids) that by no experimental means can be distinguish from each other. Which is not possible, if that situation happens;
								the two are the same (i.e. same solids), therefore there exists a unique wavefunction for a given external potential. A second possibility to consider is given
								two different wavefunctions a same density can be calculated, which is also not true. To prove the second possibility, if Ψ ≠ Ψ’, then ρ ≠ ρ’, assume Ψ ≠ Ψ’
								and ρ = ρ’, which should lead to a contradiction. Ψ is the ground state of a Hamiltonian H with ground state energy Egs and Ψ’ is the ground state of a
								Hamiltonian H’ with ground state energy is E’gs. For same number of electrons, otherwise inconsequential result, the terms of the individual Hamiltonians are
								H = T + W + V and H’ = T + W + V’. The two Hamiltonians differ only in their external potentials V and V’ so first Hamiltonian can be written as H = H’ - V’
								+ V and vice versa. According to the variation theorem, use of any normalized well-behaved function that differs from the ground-state wavefunction will make
								the variational integral greater than E0. Therefore using the two wavefunctions interchangeable with a given Hamiltonians provides the following inequalities
								and Since ρ = ρ’, adding the two inequalities, the two integrals cancel and the result is . This is a contradictory result of assuming ρ = ρ’ when Ψ ≠ Ψ’ [P.
								Hohenberg and W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. 136B (1964) 864]. The external potential υ(ri) is a injective function of the wavefunction, meaning external potential can
								be uniquely connected to a wavefunction  and in turn a wavefunction is a injective function of the probability density, meaning a wavefunction can be uniquely
								connected to a probability density. Consequently, any observable ground state property of the many-electron system can be written as a unique functional of the
								density. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the ground state density of a many-electron system and the external potential.
								Each of the expectation value in this equation is a molecular property determined by the ground-state electronic wavefunction, which is determined by ρ0(x,y,z).
								Therefore, each term is a function of ρ0:
								Square brackets denote a functional relation and υ subscript emphasizes the dependence of E0 is on the external potential υ(r), which is unique for each molecule.
								To appreciate this result, understanding of functional is needed, without going into too much mathematical detail. A function space is a space made of functions
								and each function in the space can be thought of as a point, so a functional F(f) is a rule that associates a number (point in space) with each function f. A
								functional maps function onto a number, real or complex. The density function is much simpler than the wavefunction, the wavefunction has 3N dimension to keep
								track of but density function has only three dimensions, no matter how many electrons in the system. Hohenberg and Kohn’s result can be restated as the ground-state
								energy E0 is functional of density ρ0 and can be express as E0 = E0[ρ0]. This is why this field is known as density functional theory.
								The Hohenberg-Kohn variation theorem states that for every trial density function ρtr(r) that satisfies ∫ ρtr(r) dr = n and ρtr(r) ≥ 0 for all r, the following
								inequality holds: E0 ≤ Ev[ρtr]. The variation theorem allows us to calculate an upper bound for the system’s ground-state energy using the trial electron probability
								density, similar to trial wavefunction, when variational integral is taken. The lowest energy is the ground state, no matter which trial function is applied, the
								eigenvalue cannot be lower than the ground-state energy so it’s a matter of coming up with a better guess for the electron probability density function and that
								will lead closer to the true ground-state energy.</span></div>
