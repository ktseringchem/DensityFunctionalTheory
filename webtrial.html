  <p>Aerosols are minute particles suspended in the atmosphere. It can be solid particles or liquid droplets. Size
    ranges from few nm to several micrometers. They are ubiquitous in the Earth’s atmosphere and can be found over
    ocean, deserts, mountains, forests, ice and every ecosystem in between. Aerosols have major impact on our climate,
    by interacting both directly and indirectly with the incoming solar radiation, and health through inhalation of
    these particles. They also serve as a site for heterogeneous chemical reaction leading to destruction of stratosphere
    ozone. Although most aerosols reflect sunlight, some absorb it. Aerosol’s effect on light depends primarily on the
    composition and color of the particles, both of which	depends on how the molecules of the aerosol interacting with
    light $ \Psi $.</p>
